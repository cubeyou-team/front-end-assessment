# Assessment for Frontend Position

Here at Helixa one of the main task for a frontend developer is to build useful interfaces in order to display, search and interact with data.

Fot this assessment it is not important to have a great UI in terms of design, but we need to have a consistent and working interface allowing the users to work with data without frictions.

## Introduction

For this assignment what you will build is a single pgae application with React for querying a dataset of NBA players and their stats.

You will consume this free API: https://www.balldontlie.io/

Endpoints needed to complete the assessment:
- Players list: GET https://www.balldontlie.io/api/v1/players
- Player stats: GET https://www.balldontlie.io/api/v1/season_averages
- Player pic: GET https://nba-players.herokuapp.com/players/{last_name}/{first_name}

## Tasks

We want to have an homepage with a search input that lets the user search for a specific player.
Once the user has found the player, after clicking on it, is brought to a detail page of the player where he will be able to find:

- Generic info of the player (The ones we get from the api)
- A Picture of the player
- The Player's season averages stats

## Submission

You can submit your work through:

- [GitHub](https://github.com)
- [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io)
- ...other

The code must be available to us in order to evaluate your submission.

## Evaluation

Our goal is to find answers to those questions:

- Do you master React and its ecosystem?
- Can you design interfaces that are clear and easy to use?
- Do you master your working environment?
- Can your write code that is clean, readable and efficent?
